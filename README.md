# Simple Polls
*Simple Polls is a lightweight Minecraft plugin that allows server admins to create interactive polls for players. Players can vote on polls directly in-game through an intuitive GUI, and poll results are tracked in real-time. Expired polls are automatically managed and stored separately.*

*This is a plugin designed for small SMPs to make sure that only people who actively play vote on important polls, use in large servers(200+ players) in not recommended*
